# thrush_ancestry_repeatability

Code for genomic processing and analysis associated with "Repeatable selection on large ancestry blocks in an avian hybrid zone"

### 1 Ancestry informative markers

* pipeline to define, then call ancestry informative markers
* define markers with reference panel of inland & coastal birds
* call ancestry given read counts from hybrid birds

### 2 Selection & introgression analysis

* methods to quantify selection metrics (cline gradients, ancestry transitions) & introgression metrics (cline centres, fd)
* analysis scripts to estimate repeatability, relationships to genomic structural features, and visualize results
