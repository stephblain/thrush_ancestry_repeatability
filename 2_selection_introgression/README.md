# Selection & introgression analysis

### genomic_clines

Fit genomic clines using bgc-hm

Estimate repeatability of cline centre & gradient outliers

Look for overlap with migratory loci

Fit models of relationship between ancestry transitions & genome features


### ancestry_transitions

Find the locations of ancestry transitions based on AIMs genotypes states file

Estimate repeatability of ancestry transitions, look for overlap with migratory loci

Fit models of relationships between ancestry transitions and genome features

### fd_introgression

Put together vcf with relevant SNPs for looking for introgression between coastal & inland BC Swainson's thrushes

Estimate introgression as D & fd

Fit models of relationships between introgresion and genome features

### genome_features

Estimate relevant features (Fst, positive selection, gene density) in windows

Make plots of relationships of different variables to genome features
